# RS-Knight Stego: A Robust Image Steganography System

This project presents RS-Knight Stego, a robust image steganography system designed for secure and resilient data hiding. The system integrates **Reed-Solomon (RS) error correction codes** with a **Knight's Tour-based pixel selection algorithm** to embed data within digital images, ensuring both security and data integrity against noise.

## Overview

The core of this project is an advanced steganography technique that addresses the critical challenges of robustness and security in data hiding. The system leverages:

- **Reed-Solomon (RS) Codes**: Provides powerful error correction capabilities, allowing the embedded data to be recovered even when the steganographic image is corrupted by noise or minor modifications.
- **Knight's Tour Algorithm**: Generates a pseudo-random, non-repeating path for pixel selection during the embedding process. This enhances security by making the data's location statistically difficult to detect.
- **Dual-Layer LSB Embedding**: Utilizes both the Least Significant Bit (LSB) and the second LSB (LSB2) planes. Data is embedded in the LSB, while parity bits from the RS code are stored in the LSB2, effectively separating the payload from the error correction data.

This implementation is based on academic research and provides a complete framework, including data embedding, extraction, and a suite of analysis tools for evaluation.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Secure Data Embedding**: Hides text or binary data within lossless image formats (e.g., TIFF, PNG).
- **Error Correction & Recovery**: Reed-Solomon codes protect embedded data against transmission errors and noise.
- **Pseudo-Random Path Selection**: The Knight's Tour algorithm provides a complex and unpredictable embedding path.
- **Multi-format Support**: Optimized for lossless image formats to prevent data loss from compression.

### Analysis & Evaluation Tools
- **RS Steganalysis**: Detects potential steganographic content through statistical analysis of pixel relationships.
- **Chi-square Attack Simulation**: Implements chi-square steganalysis for security validation.
- **Oracle-Based Detector**: An advanced detection mechanism for evaluating the system's security threshold.
- **Image Quality Metrics**: Measures the visual impact of embedding using PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` package manager

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jack74387/RS-Knight-Stego.git
   cd RS-Knight-Stego
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

#### Embedding Data
```python
from stegano.encoder import StegoEncoder

# Initialize the encoder with a seed for reproducible results
encoder = StegoEncoder(seed=123)

# Embed a secret message into an image
message = b"This is a secret message!"
encoder.encode_image(
    input_path="images/cover/4.1.01.tiff",
    output_path="output/stego_image.tiff", 
    data=message
)
```

#### Extracting Data
```python
from stegano.decoder import StegoDecoder

# Initialize the decoder with the same seed used for encoding
decoder = StegoDecoder(seed=123)

# Extract the hidden message from the stego image
recovered_data = decoder.decode_image("output/stego_image.tiff")
print("Recovered message:", recovered_data.decode('utf-8'))
```

### Advanced Examples

#### Noise Resilience Testing
This example demonstrates the system's ability to recover data from a corrupted image.
```python
from stegano.encoder import StegoEncoder
from stegano.decoder import StegoDecoder
from evaluation.visualizer import add_salt_pepper_noise
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

# 1. Embed data
encoder = StegoEncoder(seed=42)
message = b"Testing error correction capabilities."
encoder.encode_image("images/cover/4.1.01.tiff", "output/stego_robustness_test.tiff", message)

# 2. Add salt-and-pepper noise to the stego image
stego_image = np.array(Image.open("output/stego_robustness_test.tiff"))
noisy_image = add_salt_pepper_noise(stego_image, amount=0.01)
Image.fromarray(noisy_image).save("output/stego_noisy.tiff")

# 3. Attempt to extract data from the noisy image
decoder = StegoDecoder(seed=42)
recovered = decoder.decode_image("output/stego_noisy.tiff")

# 4. Verify results
print("Original Message:", message.decode())
print("Recovered Message:", recovered.decode())
print("Recovery Successful:", message == recovered)
```

## Technical Details

### Algorithm Overview

The RS-Knight Stego algorithm operates as follows:

1.  **Data Preparation**: The input data is prefixed with a 4-byte header indicating its length. The combined data is then segmented into 4-byte blocks.
2.  **Reed-Solomon Encoding**: Each 4-byte block is encoded using an RS(7,4) scheme, which produces a 7-byte codeword consisting of the original 4 data bytes and 3 parity bytes for error correction.
3.  **Path Generation**: The Knight's Tour algorithm is initialized with a seed and generates a pseudo-random sequence of pixel coordinates. This path is non-repeating to ensure that each pixel is used at most once for a given block.
4.  **Dual-Layer Embedding**: For each 7-byte codeword, the system selects 12 pixels from the generated path.
    -   The 32 bits of **data** are embedded into the **LSB** plane of the first 11 pixels (3 bits per pixel).
    -   The 24 bits of **parity** are embedded into the **LSB2** plane of the first 8 pixels.
5.  **Extraction and Recovery**: The process is reversed during extraction. The system traverses the same pixel path, extracts the data and parity bits from the LSB and LSB2 planes, and uses the Reed-Solomon decoder to correct any errors and recover the original 4-byte data block.

### Configuration Parameters

Key parameters of the system can be adjusted in `config.py`:

```python
# Reed-Solomon code parameters (default is n=7, k=4, nsym=3)
RS_N = 255  # Total codeword length for a different RS scheme
RS_K = 223  # Data portion length for a different RS scheme

# RS Steganalysis parameters
MASK_SIZE = (8, 8)    # Analysis window size
THRESHOLD = 0.1       # Detection sensitivity threshold
```

## Performance Characteristics

The system's performance is characterized by a trade-off between embedding capacity, visual quality, and robustness.

-   **Embedding Capacity**: The theoretical payload is approximately **0.375 bits per pixel (bpp)** for a 24-bit color image. The overhead from the RS(7,4) code is significant (3 parity bytes for every 4 data bytes) but is essential for robustness.
-   **Visual Quality**: Embedding typically results in a **PSNR value greater than 40 dB**, indicating that the visual distortion is minimal and generally imperceptible to the human eye.
-   **Error Correction Capability**: The RS(7,4) code can correct up to **1 byte of error** within each 7-byte codeword. This allows the system to withstand a salt-and-pepper noise level of approximately **1-2%** without data loss.
